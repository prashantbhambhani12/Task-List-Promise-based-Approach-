# Title
### Task List (Module Based Approach)

# Description
### This is task list created with vanilla javascript with Prmises based structure defined in ecma standards

# Structure

#### This project consists of 2 basic files.
##### 1) html file
##### 2) style.css
#### and js folder that contains 3 files
##### 3) index.js file
##### 4) functions.js file
##### 5) events.js file
#### 
1) The index.html file consists of table-based-skeleton-structure and is bootstrap based. The table-head holds the task-creation phase, whereas the table-body contains the created tasks' list.
2) The major part of html skeleton is dressed with the help of Bootstrap, however some minor fine tunnings(related to colours,typography etc.etc accross various devices ) are achieved with the help of css.  
3) The js folders manages the whole functionality of this site. The script is mainly responsible for •Form-Handling, •Handling attached Events, •Accessing and Manipulating DOM,etc,etc.

a) index.js (entry point for all js with access to dom with type of module.)

b) events.js (It was created to create modules(reusable functions) that can attach events to
elements and do the task mentioned in the callback function when the event gets fired)

c) function.js (This file hold the functions that can be invoked to make repeated tasks easier)

I must say that the code here in js folder is clean, organized and above-all REUSABLE. It's just PURE VANILLA JAVASCRIPT but the
approach is based on modules structure, defined in ecma script.
